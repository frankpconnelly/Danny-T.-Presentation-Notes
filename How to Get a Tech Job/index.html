            <p>Angie Del Castillo; Senior recruiter at JP Morgan Chase. Recruits software engineer from non-normal backgrounds. When sourcing candidates, she started with connecting with coding bootcamps' career services personnel. Learned about the skillsets the students were learning. Now do a lot of "in-bound" sourcing. Hold info sessions, walk through interview process. Whoever wants to apply is welcome to do so. Program is called "Emerging Talent Software Engineers."</p>
            <p>Melissa Guerrero; Design manager. HTML/CSS/JavaScript. Was a teacher for 7 years, and changed into tech after one year. Looks for self starters and self-directed learners. Same with Angie.</p>
            <p>Perry Wright; Senior Technical Sales recruiter at Palo Alto Networks. "Having drive cannot be overstated." Met a guy named Cory Floyd. He got out, made certifcations on his own, made meaningful connections with people in his company. Got foot in the door to the Academy Program. "I can teach technology, but I can't teach drive." Getting certifications is important. As a recruiter, he searches through LinkedIn, looking for skills. Uses Boolean searches for skills that candidates have on their resume.</p>

            <p>How do I demonstrate "drive" on a resume? Angie knows that boot camps are time-intensive. She knows that if someone is willing to go through all that, she sees that someone has put in the work. Melissa looks for volunteer work, hackathons, certifications. Contribute to open source projects like Hacktober fest. Perry likes a curiosity. "I picked apart a router, made a firewall by myself, made a raspberry pi, etc."</p>
            <p>Have the "about me" section filled out on LinkedIn. </p>
            <p>Job descriptions: don't just talk about the job. Talk about the volunteering things, the great things, the accolades, how you helped.</p>
            <p>The big project needs to actually solve a problem. Don't just do a code-along from YouTube.</p>
            <p>Interview: use the STAR method! Give them the detail they're looking for. Interview: ask no more than 5 questions. Interviews start out as an interrogation; it's my job to turn it into a conversation. 80%+ employers said that if employees weren't asking questions back at the interviews, it didn't seem like they wanted the job.</p>
            <p>Research the company. Go to the website. Go to the social media pages. Work that into the interview conversation. "I've seen what you're doing, and it aligns with what I want."</p>
            <p>Melissa is not looking for 11 quarterbacks, she's looking for particular skills. Don't fake it, be real.</p>
            <p>Come in with questions towards the end. Interviewers are impressed by this.</p>
            <p>Question: "To you, what does success look like for this position 6 months from now?" This gives me the road map for 6 months from now to get a promotion.</p>
            <p>Chat GPT: "I want to create a resume. Here's what I did with this role, blah blah blah. Put it into four bullet points for my resume." Utilize Chat GPT to help create my whole resume and LinkedIn profile. Put it in my own words though! START with it, but then add my stuff.</p>
